# Wisecars
Developed a dynamic car renting website featuring a user-friendly
interface and comprehensive backend functionality. The platform
allows users to easily rent cars on a daily basis, offering a diverse
range of vehicle options to choose from. Implemented secure user
data storage during the payment process. Leveraged a
combination of front-end technologies for an intuitive user
experience and back-end systems for robust data management.
This project demonstrated my ability to create a seamless online
service, merging customer preferences with technical proficiency
